        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 lb lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>28g taco seasoning package</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth or water</li>
            <li>1 cup grated cheese</li>
            <li>(optional) 1 1/4 cup salsa</li>
            <li>(optional) 1 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
                 Add in the diced onion and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add in the ground beef and continue cooking until browned.
                 Add in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in the taco seasoning, rice, broth, and salsa.
                 Bring the mixture up to a boil and then cover and reduce heat to low.
                  Cook for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and
                   the rice is tender, stirring occasionally so rice doesn’t stick.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in the cheese and cilantro and stir to combine.
                 Remove the skillet from the heat, cover and let sit for 2
                  minutes for the cheese to melt. Season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        </ol>
